so what i have essentially used here is just the vanilla Lazyvim  along with a few additional keymaps


the whole file structure looks something like this:

nvim 
  -lua
      -config
          -autocmds.lua
          - keymaps.lua
          - lazy.lua
          - options.lua
      - plugins
          - example.lua 
  -LICENSE
  -README
  -init.lua
  -lazy-lock.json
  -lazyvim.json
  -stylua.toml
