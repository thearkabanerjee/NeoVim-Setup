so what i have essentially used here is just the vanilla Lazyvim  along with a few additional keymaps


the whole file structure looks something like this:

nvim 
  -lua
      -config
          -autocmds.lua
          - keymaps.lua
          - lazy.lua
          - options.lua
      - plugins
          - example.lua 
  -
